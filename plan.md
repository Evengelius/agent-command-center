# Current Plan

The active plan with its progress, the owner's standing decisions, and one
entry per closed plan. Each plan comes from `doc/brief.md` and its
amendments, ends with the evaluation summary of `doc/evaluation.md`, and
waits for the owner's approval before the next one starts. This file keeps
the current state only (the owner, 2026-10-18): a closed plan's full text,
criteria and progress log are in git (`git show 8888f59:plan.md` for plans 1
to 13, `git show 84d2ad8:plan.md` for plan 14, `git show b047434:plan.md`

55e2bed:plan.md` for plan 39), and its results in its evaluation file.

## The owner's standing decisions

Decisions of closed plans that still apply; `AGENTS.md` and
`doc/evaluation.md` hold the others.

- **Live runs.** Each one is proposed first with its scope, model, expected
  usage and stopping conditions, and runs only once approved (plan 3,
  2026-10-16); Claude runs use Haiku as a per-process override.
- **The configuration check is hash-only**: credential contents are never
  read, and a file that cannot be classified safely is "changed, not
  classified", never reported unchanged (2026-10-16). No parser runs over a
  file that may hold credentials (the mixed-state tokenizer was withdrawn,
  2026-10-16); the one exception is confcheck's key-level comparison of
  `~/.claude.json`, sensitive keys skipped (plan 5).
- **Measured, not assumed.** Performance figures are targets until a test
  measures them; a documented design is never presented as verified runtime
  behaviour (2026-10-16).
- **The integration.** If driving a CLI without a terminal falls short, the
  limit is documented and the smallest adjustment proposed; the architecture
  never changes silently (2026-10-16).
- **Drafts and session data** survive cancellation, crashes and recovery; no
  conversation data is stored beyond the draft, and nothing sensitive goes
  into a log (2026-10-16).
- **Zone A shows values, not notes** (amendment 25, 2026-10-22, plan 26):
  its telemetry pane carries no notes row, legend or counter, now or in
  any later plan; errors, retries, unrecognised lines, freshness and the
  legends live in the details view (Enter on TELEMETRY), where each value
  has its source and age. An undocumented value keeps its "†" mark where
  it is shown.

## Recurring

Tasks tagged **[Recurring]** repeat on an outside event: they are never
closed, never listed as remaining, and each occurrence is reported in the
summary format (the owner, 2026-10-18).

- **[Recurring] After a CLI update.** At session start, `claude --version`
  and `codex --version` are compared with the "Last probed" line of
  `doc/research/probes/README.md`; a newer one is told to the owner with the
  re-check proposed (`doc/evaluation.md`, After a CLI update), which runs
  only once the owner approves it. The dashboard's project bar shows
  "newer than tested" meanwhile. Last occurrence: Claude Code 2.1.303 on
  2026-10-19, approved, every check PASS (P303a to P303d in
  `doc/research/probes/README.md`); it found that plan 14's shape check
  counted an interrupted tool use as unrecognised, fixed the same day at the
  owner's request (P303e).

## Nice to have

Items tagged **[Nice to have]** are future improvements: none is built, and
none is listed as remaining, until the owner asks for one in a new plan
(the owner, 2026-10-18). Amendment 4 names ten "future improvements"
(`doc/brief.md`, Amendment 4, "For this phase, do NOT implement"). Five
remain below. Recent projects, favourites and a project browser were plan 15
(amendment 9), the browser replaced by the system's folder dialog in plan
52 (amendment 53); git worktree management was plan 16 (amendment 10). The
automatic VS Code integration was replaced by the owner with a file viewer in
the terminal, plan 17 (amendment 11). The session's model, effort and
Ultracode selection was plan 34 (amendment 34); configuring models beyond the
session stays below.

- **[Nice to have]** Advanced model configuration.
- **[Nice to have]** Cross-provider agent collaboration.
- **[Nice to have]** Provider switching during an active session.
- **[Nice to have]** Complex session profiles.
- **[Nice to have]** Advanced orchestration configuration.
- **[Nice to have]** Google Antigravity as an agent CLI, removed from the
  MVP by amendment 5; the provider interface stays open to it.
- **[Nice to have]** Starting it like an app (the owner, 2026-10-19): a built
  `agent-command-center.exe` started from a Start-menu shortcut, pinnable to
  the taskbar, whose target is `wt.exe -d <projects folder> <path to the
  .exe>`, so that it always opens in Windows Terminal (the only supported
  terminal, amendments 6 and 7) with the project field at that folder; the
  `.exe` is rebuilt after each code change.

## Plan 60 - Git blame in the file viewer

Brief amendment 62 (2026-10-28): in the file viewer, beside each line, the
date and author of the commit that last changed it, after the owner's
image of an IDE's git blame ("15/11/2022 Hubaut" left of the line
numbers), the lines not committed yet shown apart. Approved by the owner
on 2026-10-28 ("Fold in and start"), with the three precisions of another
agent's review folded in: the blame of the very bytes shown, answers
never shown on another file, "Not committed" claiming no author.

### What was found (2026-10-28, on 191117f)

- The viewer (plan 17; ui-design.md, File viewer) reads a file once, in a
  command, when it is shown (`input.ReadFile`: 32 MiB at most, split at
  LF, a CR before it dropped), and never again while it is shown; showing
  it again reads it again. `SplitLines` drops the empty line after a
  final LF, so `Lines` counts lines as git does (AGENTS.md's 348; at
  step 2 this bullet, first written "348 lines for 347", was corrected).
- A row (`render.codeRow`) is the line number right-aligned, the agent's
  edit mark (`▌`, `FileView.Mark`, from the tool call that edited the
  file), a space, then the code shifted by `Left`; only the code's spans
  carry text references, so a drag copies the code alone. `FileCodeWidth`
  gives the code's cells to the shift. Above the rows, the path row (the
  path · what opened it; "colouring…" or "coloured around the view" on its
  right); under them the footer (the first key hint that fits, or a toast,
  the mouse capture's note, a waiting approval; on its right the cursor's
  line or the search).
- The window is 76 cells wide at 80x24, 96 at 120x40 and 166 maximised
  (208x59); full screen (`f`) the screen's width. Keys taken in the
  viewer: Esc, F2, F3, `f`, `/`, `g`, `n` `N`, the arrows, PgUp, PgDn,
  Home, End; `b` is free.
- No git blame anywhere yet. Git's reads go through `GitCLI.runRead` (the
  file system monitor off, no optional lock, no prompt, English), 15 s at
  most (`readLimit`), and take no standard input.
- Probes, git 2.56.0 (`scratchpad\plan60`, temporary repositories, and
  this repository read only): `git blame --porcelain -- <path>` gives each
  run of lines as `<hash> <orig> <final> <count>`, a commit's `author`,
  `author-time`, `author-tz` and `summary` the first time it appears, then
  each line's text after a tab; a line changed or added in the working
  tree has the all-zero hash and "Not Committed Yet". With `--contents -`
  the file's own bytes on standard input give the same blame as the disk,
  and other bytes are annotated as given. An untracked file fails with
  "fatal: no such path 'u.txt' in HEAD", a repository with no commit with
  "fatal: no such ref: HEAD", a folder outside git with "fatal: not a git
  repository", each exit 128; a project that is a subfolder of its
  repository takes the path relative to it. On this repository's
  longest-lived files: `doc/brief.md` (7,910 lines, 56 commits) 526 ms,
  `doc/ui-design.md` 514 ms, `plan.md` (134 commits) 453 ms,
  `internal/app/app.go` 362 ms.
- The owner was told "cached until the file changes": the viewer's own
  single read gives that, the blame read with the file holding for as long
  as it is shown. A cache across showings would need HEAD's commit in its
  key, a commit changing an unchanged file's blame, for about half a second
  saved: none.

### Design

- **D1. The switch:** `b` in the viewer shows the blame, `b` again hides
  it; off when the dashboard starts, it then holds for every file shown
  until `b` again, for the rest of the session. The key overlay and the
  viewer's key hints name `b`.
- **D2. The column:** left of the line numbers, as the owner's image, on
  every line: the commit's author date, `dd/mm/yyyy` in the machine's time
  zone (`Options.Location`, nil the machine's; the tests a fixed one), and
  the author's name as git records it, cut to 12 cells with "…", grey; a
  line not committed yet "Not committed" in the attention colour (git's own
  placeholder author for such a line never shown); the column padded so
  that the line numbers align, the cursor row's band under it. 25 cells: the date, a space, the
  name, two spaces. What it claims is git's only: "Not committed" a line
  that differs from the last commit, whoever changed it (an agent, the
  owner, a tool); a committed line's author the author of its commit, not
  necessarily who wrote it. The edit mark stays the one sign of the
  agent's own edits.
- **D3. The narrow form:** where the full column would leave the code
  fewer than 60 cells, a compact one, 14 cells: `dd/mm/yy`, a space, the
  name's initials (three at most), two spaces; "uncommitted" for a line
  not committed. At 120x40 and 208x59 the full form, at 80x24 the compact
  one; full screen follows the same rule.
- **D4. The cursor line's commit:** in the footer's left, in place of the
  key hints while the blame shows: `f52c343 · Ana Hubaut · 15/11/2022
  10:00 · Add a.txt with three lines`, the subject cut to fit; "Not
  committed yet: changed in the working tree" for such a line; a toast,
  the mouse capture's note and a waiting approval before it, as today. It
  follows the cursor (the arrows, `g`, a search).
- **D5. The read:** in a command, `git blame --porcelain --contents - --
  <path>` in the project through `runRead`, within `readLimit`, given on
  its standard input the very bytes the viewer shows, as read, CRs kept,
  so that git converts line endings as it does from the disk. With the
  blame on, the read that shows a file hands its bytes on; `b` on a file
  already shown reads it again and blames it only if its lines are still
  the ones shown. Parsed into one entry a line and one record a commit
  (its short hash, author, time and zone, subject); never a write. Each
  read carries the file's generation and a number of its own: an answer
  for a file closed, or shown in its place, or for a read `b` has since
  replaced, is dropped; only the latest counts.
- **D6. The messages**, in the footer's left while the blame shows, the
  column empty: "blame…" while git reads, the file shown meanwhile; "not
  in git yet: no history" for an untracked file; "not a git repository";
  "git not found"; "no commits yet"; "blame stopped after 15 s"; git's own
  words for any other failure; "the file changed after it was read: show
  it again" when `b`'s second read differs from the lines shown, or git's
  lines and the viewer's differ in number.
- **D7. Unchanged:** ← → shift the code alone (`FileCodeWidth` less the
  column); a drag copies the code alone; the search, go-to-line, full
  screen, the agent's edit mark, the Explorer and the quick open, plan
  58's click outside; with the blame off nothing is drawn or read.
- **D8. The budget:** the column drawn for the rows in view only, from the
  parsed entries; a key to its frame within the keystroke's 16 ms with the
  blame on, on a 10,000-line file.

### Criteria

1. **60.1 The switch:** `b` shows the column and the footer's commit, `b`
   again hides them; off at start; on, it holds for the next file shown;
   the key overlay and the viewer's hints name `b`.
2. **60.2 The column:** on a real repository, each line's date
   (`dd/mm/yyyy`, the zone given) and author cut to 12 cells, grey; a line
   changed and a line added in the working tree "Not committed" in the
   attention colour; left of the line numbers, aligned; golden frames at
   80x24, 120x40, 200x60 and 79x24.
3. **60.3 The narrow form:** the full form where the code keeps 60 cells,
   the compact one below (`15/11/22 AH`, "uncommitted"), by the window's
   width, full screen included.
4. **60.4 The footer:** the cursor line's short hash, author, date and
   time and subject, following the cursor; "Not committed yet: changed in
   the working tree"; a toast and a waiting approval first.
5. **60.5 The messages:** each of D6's, the file shown meanwhile.
6. **60.6 Unchanged:** the shift moves the code alone, its limit the
   code's width; a drag copies the code alone; the search, go-to-line,
   full screen, the edit mark, plan 58's click outside; the blame off, no
   git call.
7. **60.7 Git and the answers:** one `blame --porcelain --contents -` per
   file shown with the blame on and per `b` turning it on, through
   `runRead`, its arguments traced: no write, no optional lock; the bytes
   given its input the bytes shown, CRs kept (a CRLF file committed so
   blamed as committed, not as changed); the porcelain parsed with a
   commit's headers once and its later lines by hash; an answer dropped
   when another file was opened during its read, when the viewer was
   closed during it, and when `b` went off and on during it, only the
   latest read drawn.
8. **60.8 Windows Terminal:** in the acc tab at 208x59 and 120x40, and
   80x24's compact form: `b` on a file of a repository's history; shots;
   the owner's visual review.
9. **60.9 The checks:** build, vet (Windows, Linux), gofmt and the whole
   suite; the new golden frames reviewed, the others unchanged; the
   changes broken on purpose through `go test -overlay`, each caught; the
   timing step with the viewer's keys and the blame on within 16 ms.

### Steps

1. Amendment 62 and this plan.
2. Input: the read with a standard input, `GitCLI.Blame` and its parse
   (D5); tests on real repositories: committed, changed and added lines,
   the bytes given against the disk, an untracked file, no commits, not a
   repository, a CRLF file, many commits.
3. Rendering: the column, full and compact, the footer's commit and
   messages, the keys, `FileCodeWidth` (D2 to D4, D6, D7); golden frames.
4. The application: `b`, the reads on showing and on `b`, the generation
   and the read's number, the second read's check (D1, D5, D6); tests.
5. The documents.
6. Windows Terminal (60.8); the owner's visual review.
7. The checks, the mutants, the timing and `doc/plan60-evaluation.md`.

### Progress

- 2026-10-28: step 1: amendment 62 and this plan, proposed, then the
  review's three precisions folded in; approved by the owner ("Fold in
  and start").
- 2026-10-28: step 2 done. `input/blame.go`: `BlameGit`, `GitCLI.Blame`
  (`git blame --porcelain --contents - -- <path>`, the bytes on its
  standard input through `stream`, the file system monitor off, within
  `blameLimit`, 15 s), `parseBlame`, git's refusals named (untracked, no
  commits, outside git, the time limit: `timeoutError`, now `call`'s and
  `stream`'s, its text unchanged, `context.DeadlineExceeded` to
  `errors.Is`); `FileText.Raw`, the bytes read. Found: with `--contents`
  git names a line not committed "External file (--contents)", its hash
  all zeros as before, so the viewer goes by the hash; and the viewer
  counts lines as git does (`SplitLines` drops the empty line after a
  final LF): What was found's first bullet corrected, D2, D6 and 60.2 with
  it. Tests on real repositories (`blame_test.go`, 4): commits, authors,
  times and zones, a commit read once and its later lines by hash, the
  changed and added lines; the bytes given, not the disk's; a CRLF file
  blamed as committed from its raw bytes and as changed without its CRs;
  untracked, no commits, outside git, the time limit; the porcelain's
  parse.
- 2026-10-28: step 3 done. `render/blame.go`: `FileBlame` (in
  `FileView.Blame`), `BlameCommit` with its texts made once, the column
  (`blameCols`, `blameCell`: 25 cells, or 14 where the code would keep
  fewer than 60) and the footer's commit or note (`blameFooter`, after a
  toast, the mouse capture's note and a waiting approval, split out as
  `windowNotice`; the field's hints while one is typed). `codeRow` draws
  the column first, `FileCodeWidth` leaves it out. The key hints name `b
  blame`, the narrowest kept without it beside a long count
  (`TestFileFooters`); the key overlay's and ui-design.md's rows
  (`TestKeyOverlayRows`: 78). Tests: `TestBlameColumn`, `TestBlameWidth`,
  `TestBlameFooter`.
- 2026-10-28: step 4 done. `app/blame.go`: `b` in the viewer
  (`toggleBlame`: on a file shown, a second read compared with the lines
  shown before git is asked), the blame of the file just shown from its
  read's bytes (`blameFile`, `fileRead`), the answer kept only for the
  same file and the latest read (`blameMsg`'s generation and number,
  `blameRead`), the refusals as the footer says them (`blameProblem`), the
  commits' texts in `Options.Location` (`blameCommits`, `initials`). Tests
  (`app/blame_test.go`, a fake that can hold each call): `TestBlameSwitch`,
  `TestBlameAnswers` (another file shown during a read, the viewer closed
  during one, `b` off and on during one), `TestBlameMessages`,
  `TestBlameUnchanged` (no git with the blame off, `b` typed in the search,
  a drag copying the code alone, full screen, plan 58's click),
  `TestBlameCommits`, `TestBlameGit` (git itself: the column, the line
  changed, one call with the bytes), `TestBlameFrameCost` (10,000 lines, a
  commit every ten: p50 0.52 ms, p95 1.13 ms). Golden frames `file-blame`
  at the four sizes; the eight viewer frames whose hints row names `b
  blame` now (D1) changed in that row alone, reviewed.
- 2026-10-28: step 5 done. ui-design.md: `b` in the viewer's two key
  tables and a Git blame section (the 120x40 golden's window, the column,
  what it claims, the footer, the read, the messages, the budget);
  architecture.md, File viewer: plan 60's parts; evaluation.md: the timing
  step runs `TestBlameFrameCost` too (eighteen); AGENTS.md: the status and
  the MVP scope's git blame (amendment 62). events-and-state.md unchanged:
  the blame is a read on the owner's key, as Source Control's, not a poll.
- 2026-10-28: step 6, its measured part done. `scratchpad\term\p60run.ps1`
  on `p51.ps1`: the real application in the acc tab at 208x59, 120x40 and
  80x24, a mock dashboard (no CLI), a temporary home and app data, over a
  demo repository (`p60demo.ps1`: three authors, line 11 changed and three
  lines added in the working tree, notes.txt untracked). F3, two clicks on
  viewer.go, `b`: the full column at 208x59 and 120x40 ("15/11/2022 Ana
  Hubaut", "07/06/2024 Maximilian …", "Not committed" on lines 11 and 24 to
  26), the compact one at 80x24 ("15/11/22 AH", "uncommitted"), full
  screen too; the footer's commit following `g` to Bo Li's line, a line
  not committed and Maximilian Oberhausen's, cut with "…" at 80x24; `b`
  off and on; notes.txt opened next with the blame still on: "not in git
  yet: no history". Found: the harness's digit keys give "&", "é"… on the
  owner's AZERTY layout, so the line numbers are typed. The owner's visual
  review is outstanding.
- 2026-10-28: step 7 done. 46 mutants through `go test -overlay` in three
  runs, each caught by a failing test in the end: the first left nine
  (the bytes read without their CRs, the full form's boundary, three
  drawing details, the answer arriving while the next file is read, the
  open and on checks, "blame…" on the next file) and A5 caught only by a
  build failure; the tests strengthened (`TestReadFile`'s `Raw`,
  `TestBlameColumn`'s boundary, `TestBlameRead`, …) and A5 rewritten, the
  second round caught the ten; a third, I14, the optional locks of the
  read's environment, which `TestBlame` now checks (the read goes through
  `stream`, `runRead` taking no standard input). The timing step alone:
  the eighteen within their targets, `TestBlameFrameCost` p50 0.53 ms, p95
  1.52 ms. Build, vet (Windows, Linux), gofmt, the whole suite.
  `doc/plan60-evaluation.md`: 8 PASS, 0 FAIL, 60.8's last part, the
  owner's visual review, not verified.
- 2026-10-28: 60.8's visual review done by the owner ("Looks right"): 9
  PASS, 0 FAIL. Not committed: the commit waits for the owner's approval.

## Plan 1 - Research

The agent CLIs and how to drive them, telemetry, terminal input, the
reference projects, and the decision to build rather than fork
(`doc/research/`). Accepted on 2026-10-16, 9 PASS and criteria 8 and 9 kept as
FAIL, documented exceptions
([`doc/research/plan1-evaluation.md`](doc/research/plan1-evaluation.md));
commit 7e4d67c.

([`doc/plan4-evaluation.md`](doc/plan4-evaluation.md)); commits ded53d8 to
cf58739.

## Plan 5 - Post-MVP improvements

The list plan 4 left open, Windows only. Approved on 2026-10-17, 17 of 17

897f640, 6813c0e.

## Plan 6 - Plan 5's known limits

Four known limits fixed, then items 5 and 6 added by the owner. Approved on
2026-10-17, 6 of 6 and 8 of 8 PASS
([`doc/plan6-evaluation.md`](doc/plan6-evaluation.md)); commits df273fe,

## Plan 7 - The open list after plan 6

The open list cleaned. Approved on 2026-10-17, 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan7-evaluation.md`](doc/plan7-evaluation.md)); commit bffe9a5.

## Plan 8 - Codex's allow for the session

`acceptForSession` on Codex 0.163.0. Approved on 2026-10-17, 6 of 6 PASS
and its follow-up 3 of 3 ([`doc/plan8-evaluation.md`](doc/plan8-evaluation.md));
commits e75d591, 1daeec1.

## Plan 9 - Plan 8's items left not verified

Two items verified, the third recorded as not verifiable. Approved on
2026-10-18, 6 of 6 PASS
([`doc/plan9-evaluation.md`](doc/plan9-evaluation.md)); commits
c9576d9, 8dea129.

## Plan 10 - A spawned Codex agent's label and the timing step

Both items verified. Approved on 2026-10-18, 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan10-evaluation.md`](doc/plan10-evaluation.md)); commits b71c114,
621609e.

## Plan 11 - A live approval offering the allow for the session

The live approval closed as not verifiable, by the owner's choice.
Approved on 2026-10-18, 3 of 3 PASS
([`doc/plan11-evaluation.md`](doc/plan11-evaluation.md)); commits 81f3bf8,
cb206b6.

## Plan 12 - Manual or Auto approvals

Brief amendment 8: a per-session switch between Manual and each CLI's own
Auto. Approved on 2026-10-18, 18 of 19 PASS and 1 FAIL accepted
([`doc/plan12-evaluation.md`](doc/plan12-evaluation.md)); commits cb31557,
83fa023.

## Plan 13 - A reviewer's refusal live

Claude Code's classifier denial seen live and a render defect it exposed
fixed; Codex's reviewer not reached, closed by the owner. Approved on
2026-10-18, 14 PASS and 3 not observed
([`doc/plan13-evaluation.md`](doc/plan13-evaluation.md));
commits d68bb55, 8888f59.

## Plan 14 - Nothing left open

Every open question of the research files settled or closed by the owner,
Claude Code's question card built and seen live, the documents reduced to
the latest state and a CLI update made visible. Approved on 2026-10-18, 18
PASS and 15 PASS ([`doc/plan14-evaluation.md`](doc/plan14-evaluation.md));
commits 0206ac1, ce06b97.

## Plan 15 - Recent projects, favourites and a project browser

Brief amendment 9: the startup screen's project list (`projects.json`,
favourites first) and its Ctrl+O browser. Approved on 2026-10-18, 21 PASS
([`doc/plan15-evaluation.md`](doc/plan15-evaluation.md)); commits bd9ffa3,
b047434.

## Plan 16 - Git worktree management

Brief amendment 10: the Worktrees view (Ctrl+W, at startup and in session)
with create, list, diff, merge and remove, git through `os/exec`. Approved
on 2026-10-18, 26 PASS
([`doc/plan16-evaluation.md`](doc/plan16-evaluation.md)); commits ce95ba2,
fad6d20, 642c5b9, becfb34.

## Plan 17 - A file viewer in the terminal

Brief amendments 11, 12 and 13: a file viewer in the terminal with Chroma's
highlighting, an Explorer of the project (F3) and the draft in a window
(Ctrl+G), with no external editor. Approved on 2026-10-19, 91 PASS
([`doc/plan17-evaluation.md`](doc/plan17-evaluation.md)); commits 1748808,
10c3e74, 904f9a6, 749cef4.

## Plan 18 - An adaptive layout

Brief amendment 14: zone C sized by the agents in play, a strip of 4 rows (3
under 100 columns) when there are none, and cleared at each new prompt.
Approved on 2026-10-19, 22 PASS
([`doc/plan18-evaluation.md`](doc/plan18-evaluation.md)); commit 8b3b16b.

## Plan 19 - Zone B as the centerpiece

Brief amendment 15: one speaker label per exchange, RESULT over an
exchange's outcome, compact tool rows and folds of long runs of calls, each
entry's turn (`Entry.Stage`). Done on 2026-10-20, 19 PASS
([`doc/plan19-evaluation.md`](doc/plan19-evaluation.md)). The owner
reviewed it in a demo the same day and asked for plan 20 (amendment 16),
which keeps its logic and replaces its look; not committed on its own, it
was committed with plan 20 once the owner approved that, on 2026-10-20;
commit d84e5d4.

## Plan 20 - Strict conformance to the approved templates

Brief amendments 16 and 17: the owner's two templates as one design
system, A and B in one upper row and C full width under them, zone B's
messages as blocks with a rule between them, the tool rows, the folds, the
pending approval's pink box and RESULT. Approved on 2026-10-20 after the
owner's live review, 32 of 32 PASS
([`doc/plan20-evaluation.md`](doc/plan20-evaluation.md)); commit d84e5d4,
with plan 19.

## Plan 21 - What the review of d84e5d4 found

A read-only review of commit d84e5d4: zone D's session time past 2,000
events, two timed tests outside the timing step, Claude Code's
undocumented `api_message_id` labelled with a fallback, zone C's floor at
160x24 to 160x26, and documents promising what the code did not do (the
send and newline keys built in `config.json`, the others corrected).
Approved on 2026-10-20 with the recommended choices, 38 PASS and 2 FAIL,
then the long session's frame time fixed at the owner's request, 6 PASS
([`doc/plan21-evaluation.md`](doc/plan21-evaluation.md)); commits bdc4250,
f939d96.

## Plan 22 - A live thinking indicator

Brief amendments 18 to 20: zone B's live thinking card for Claude Code and
Codex, with its animations, a summary row for each thinking phase that
opens on its details, and an activity line while a turn works; corrections
C1 to C12 from a read-only investigation
([`doc/plan22-investigation.md`](doc/plan22-investigation.md)); Codex
started through the local proxy that `config.json` names (amendment 19);
Codex's reasoning summaries asked for and Claude Code's hook events known
(amendment 20), checked live with one Codex turn (L20). Approved on
2026-10-21: 31 of 31 PASS, then the corrections 17 of 18 with 5.14 fixed,
amendment 20 13 of 13, and L20 8 of 8 once two criteria were corrected
([`doc/plan22-evaluation.md`](doc/plan22-evaluation.md)); commits
e6895c6, 6306bfb and d13ef71, then the approval commit.

## Plan 23 - The acc launcher in the project

Brief amendment 21: `acc`, typed in Windows Terminal, opens the dashboard
in a tab of its own at the owner's size, a 9 pt font. `acc.cmd` at the root
runs `scripts\acc.ps1`, which writes a Terminal fragment for the profile
and makes Terminal reload. The day's machine-local changes were undone.
Approved on 2026-10-22, 6 of 6 PASS before the commit, then committed and
pushed ([`doc/plan23-evaluation.md`](doc/plan23-evaluation.md)); commit
e8d3e3b, then the approval commit.

## Plan 24 - Zone A with the telemetry, zone D removed

Brief amendment 22: zone A redrawn after the owner's image, holding the
orchestrator's dynamic status, the stages as blocks and zone D's telemetry
(session usage, quota windows with lavender bars and countdowns, the notes,
the details view); zone D removed; Fable and Mythos as model families.
Amendment 23, after the owner's live session: the Claude adapter reads the
`/usage` report after the handshake and after each turn, so the
model-scoped "Fable limit" shows live, the exchange kept out of the
conversation. Approved on 2026-10-22: 35 of 35 PASS with the conformance
table 22 rows PASS, amendment 23 6 of 6 and its live check 8 of 8
([`doc/plan24-evaluation.md`](doc/plan24-evaluation.md)); commits 6209267
and a3bfe5d, then the approval commit.

## Plan 25 - The unrecognised lines named

Brief amendment 24: the owner's scenario 1 run on Fable 5.1 ended with
"unrecognised 2" and no way to see which lines. The details view now lists
the last 20 unrecognised lines with their time, type, reason and text; a
replay tool names them from a logging wrapper's record; the owner's two,
named by a logged rerun, were `system/task_summary`, known with no event
since. Approved on 2026-10-22: 7 of 7 PASS, two live runs
([`doc/plan25-evaluation.md`](doc/plan25-evaluation.md)); commit cb8f76d,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 26 - Zone A without notes

Brief amendment 25: the owner asked to get rid of zone A's notes
("unrecognised 1", "quota updated", "† undocumented field", "cost at API
rates") completely and forever. The telemetry pane now ends with the last
quota window's rows; the counts, ages and legends live in the details view,
where an undocumented value keeps its "†" and the heading explains it; a
standing decision. Approved on 2026-10-22: 6 of 6 PASS, 51 golden frames
reviewed ([`doc/plan26-evaluation.md`](doc/plan26-evaluation.md)); commit
a9a5145, then the approval commit.

## Plan 27 - Zone C with the execution timeline

Brief amendments 26 and 27: the owner's design of zone C and its
close-ups, to respect strictly. Zone C from 100 columns: the header
inside the frame, a rule and the panels' line in the title colour, the
agents' panel as wide as its two-column cards (the label over the clock
and the tokens, a grey bar, the model over the current tool; the selected
agent's rows on a band) and the selected agent's execution timeline with
its status at the heading's right end; the narrow layout keeps plan 18's
row. Approved on 2026-10-22: 15 of 16 PASS, 27.6 corrected with a note
at the owner's decision, 46 golden frames, Windows Terminal screenshots
at 208x59 and 120x40 against the images
([`doc/plan27-evaluation.md`](doc/plan27-evaluation.md)); commit 041e7b8,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 28 - The top right after the owner's image

Brief amendment 28: the owner's close-up of the top right, "● LIVE" over
"Claude Code 2.1.303" over zone B's edge with "Idle". The project bar's
right end is the provider's name and version alone while approvals are
Manual with no change asked; the mode shows there only as Auto or while
changing. Approved on 2026-10-22: 6 of 6 PASS, 27 golden frames, a
Windows Terminal screenshot against the image
([`doc/plan28-evaluation.md`](doc/plan28-evaluation.md)); commit 8fe0077,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 29 - The input editor's row after the owner's image

Brief amendment 29: the owner's image of the editor's row, design only.
Under the draft a separator, then " + " and the pill " <model> High ·
Ultracode " on the tool rows' ground, the editor's messages and the line
count in the free middle, "↯ Auto" at the right end; the "+", "High ·
Ultracode" and "Auto" are placeholders with no function. Zone B is one
row shorter. Approved on 2026-10-22: 7 of 7 PASS, 59 golden frames,
Windows Terminal screenshots at 208x59 and 120x40 against the image
([`doc/plan29-evaluation.md`](doc/plan29-evaluation.md)); commit d696f22,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 30 - The "+" menu after the owner's image

Brief amendment 30: the owner's image of the "+" clicked, design first. A
click on the editor row's band opens a three-row box above the editor's
rule, "🗀  Upload from computer", the band and the item under the
pointer on the active ground (`#272745`), the terminal asked for every
mouse motion only while it is open; Esc, any key or a click elsewhere
closes it; the item does nothing yet, the upload being a later plan's.
Approved on 2026-10-22: 6 of 6 PASS, four golden frames added, Windows
Terminal screenshots with a real click and pointer moves at 208x59 and
120x40 against the image
([`doc/plan30-evaluation.md`](doc/plan30-evaluation.md)); commit 6025513,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 31 - Image upload

Brief amendment 31: the "+" menu's "Upload from computer" works. The
system's Open dialog, several images at once, each checked by its bytes
(PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, ICO and WebP accepted, the orientation
applied, conversions to PNG, an image over a provider's limits scaled
down and said so; HEIC, AVIF, JPEG XL, JPEG 2000, PSD, TGA, DDS, HDR,
EXR, camera raws and SVG refused by name); chips under the editor's
rule, removable; sent only when the owner submits, as base64 image
blocks to Claude Code and `image` inputs holding data URLs to Codex, no
event keeping the bytes (Codex writes them back). Approved on
2026-10-23: 9 of 9 PASS, eight golden frames added, the real dialog in
Windows Terminal, live turns on Claude Code (Haiku 5.5) and Codex
(gpt-6-sol) naming the colours and the text, and a third on Codex
checking the echo fix
([`doc/plan31-evaluation.md`](doc/plan31-evaluation.md)); commit 8e2a721,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 32 - Image paste and preview

Brief amendment 32: paste an image as in the owner's chat, and a preview
before sending. Alt+V attaches the clipboard's images (copied files, the
"PNG" format's bytes, else the bitmap as PNG); Ctrl+V pastes text as
before and, when Windows Terminal keeps its press for want of text,
attaches the image on the key's lone release (undocumented, probe P32a);
a paste of the copied files' paths attaches them when all are images;
a pasted image is held in memory only. With Sixel graphics, the images
show as thumbnails between the rule and the chips, rounded squares cut
from their centre, 14x7 cells from 50 rows, 10x5 from 30, side by side
one cell apart (the owner's remark on the screenshots), drawn after the
frame and again after any frame that changes their rows, a vacated
place written over with the frame's cells. Approved on 2026-10-23: 10 of
10 PASS, four golden frames added, Windows Terminal at 208x59 and
120x40 with the owner's clipboard saved and restored, the remark in a
follow-up ([`doc/plan32-evaluation.md`](doc/plan32-evaluation.md));
commit b56d23e, then the approval commit.

## Plan 33 - Unsent drafts and images through crashes and restarts

Brief amendment 33: whether unsent image attachments survive a crash, a
forced termination, a restart and a resumed session; an investigation
first, then its nine corrections. Each dashboard's draft has a folder of
its own, its lock held while the dashboard owns it, taken back by the
project's next start (its own CLI's first, then the newest); images are
saved at once, the text every 500 ms; pasted images are kept as
`<sha256>.png` until their message is accepted; a message waiting for
its acceptance is stored with what was typed since; Back forgets the
attachments; a damaged list is set aside; a changed file is attached
again as it is now; refused renames and failed saves are tried again;
unused files are swept at each start. An independent review found five
defects, fixed; on the owner's questions, a Codex session resumed with
images, a slow and an offline share were simulated, fixed where they
lost data, and a logoff was not simulated. Approved on 2026-10-23: 14 of
14 PASS and the follow-up
([`doc/plan33-evaluation.md`](doc/plan33-evaluation.md)); commit
bc5d92b, then the approval commit.

## Plan 34 - The model selector, its effort and Ultracode

Brief amendment 34: a click on the editor row's model pill, or Alt+P,
opens the active CLI's own models with the effort and, for Claude Code,
Ultracode, after the owner's image. Claude Code's list comes from
`initialize`, its changes go by `set_model` and `apply_flag_settings`
and are read back by the undocumented `get_settings`; Codex's list from
every page of `model/list`, its changes ride the next `turn/start`,
read back by `thread/read`. The screen shows a value only once the CLI
reports it in force; an effort held by `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` is
shown and never changed; Claude Code's changes wait for a turn's end. An
independent review found four defects and six doubts, fixed, and three
small points on its second pass. At the owner's request
`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` was removed from their Claude Code settings,
and the dashboard then set the effort live; amendment 35, an opt-in line
telling the agent its settings, was built and withdrawn. Approved on
2026-10-24: 20 of 21 PASS, 34.18 (golden frames changed beyond the
pill's values) accepted
([`doc/plan34-evaluation.md`](doc/plan34-evaluation.md)); commit
47b50ce, then the approval commit.

## Plan 35 - The Ultracode toggle after the owner's image

Brief amendment 36: the owner's image of the Ultracode toggle, a lavender
pill with fully rounded ends and a round white knob, against the
dashboard's `▐   ●▌`. Where the terminal draws Sixel, the toggle is an
image over blank cells of its row, drawn as the preview's thumbnails are:
a pill of 40x20 pixels in an image of five cells whose last carries the
band, since the renderer writes every cell between a row's first and last
changes and a band cell after the image made it blink when the band came
or went (bursts of captures in Windows Terminal); without Sixel, a text
pill of Powerline's half circles. Approved on 2026-10-24: 8 of 8 PASS
([`doc/plan35-evaluation.md`](doc/plan35-evaluation.md)); commit
b43cf46, then the approval commit.

## Plan 36 - The selector's cursor and a pointer that has not moved

Brief amendment 37: Alt+P could reopen the model selector with its
cursor on the row under a resting pointer, so that Enter acted on that
row. The probe (Bubble Tea's `TEA_TRACE`) showed Windows Terminal
reporting a pointer put down by software, without its moving, once the
selector asked for every motion, its reports wandering a cell. The
selector now moves its cursor only when the pointer comes onto another
row than the last report's, the first report after Alt+P only recording
where it rests. Approved on 2026-10-24: 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan36-evaluation.md`](doc/plan36-evaluation.md)); commit
c0cebc4, then the approval commit.

## Plan 37 - The effort slider after the owner's images

Brief amendment 38: the owner's five images of one pill-shaped effort
slider at five levels replaced the selector's effort dropdown. Effort
reads "Effort (<level>)", "Controls reasoning depth" and the slider: the
model's own levels as dots, a fill of `#6784C1` growing to the thumb,
the whole pill lit by a purple gradient with specks at the highest
level, a level asked for ringed, a held effort greyed; with Sixel an
image of 170x20 pixels over 17 blank cells, its thumb gliding in 180 ms;
without, 16 text cells. Effort and Ultracode share label, description
and control columns; ← → and a click on the slider ask for a level.
Approved on 2026-10-24: 9 of 9 PASS
([`doc/plan37-evaluation.md`](doc/plan37-evaluation.md)); commit
31c22ef, then the approval commit.

## Plan 38 - Instant Codex model and effort changes, as in VS Code

Brief amendment 39: a Codex model or effort change took effect only with
the next message, where VS Code's Codex extension changes it at once. The
dashboard now asks for Codex's experimental API at initialize, as that
extension does, and writes a change between turns at once with
`thread/settings/update`, the `thread/settings/updated` that follows
putting it in force (P38x: 1 to 3 ms); a change asked during a turn is
written at its end; a Codex that refuses the update takes every change
with the next message, as before. Approved on 2026-10-24: 12 of 12 PASS
([`doc/plan38-evaluation.md`](doc/plan38-evaluation.md)); commit
dc9c6d9, then the approval commit.

## Plan 39 - The permission modes selector after the owner's images

Brief amendment 40: the editor row's right-hand "Auto" became the mode
pill of the owner's third image, and opens a "MODES" popup after the
first two: the active CLI's own modes (Claude Code's Manual, Edit
automatically, Plan and Auto; Codex's Ask for approval, Approve for me and
Full access), each applied through the CLI (`set_permission_mode`; the
experimental `thread/settings/update` with the presets of VS Code's Codex
extension) and shown in force only once the CLI reports it; Codex's Full
access only after a confirmation. The icons, the check and the band's
rounded ends are Sixel strips beside the text cells, the pill a Sixel
image whose title Windows' GDI draws. Approved on 2026-10-24: 15 of 15
PASS ([`doc/plan39-evaluation.md`](doc/plan39-evaluation.md)); commit
55e2bed, then the approval commit.

## Plan 40 - No empty rows in zone C's execution timeline

Brief amendment 41: on Codex, zone C's execution timeline and the
inspection's Messages tab showed a subagent's rows "assistant │" with no
text, one for each of its reasoning steps: since plan 22 a subagent's
reasoning summaries leave assistant entries holding only a thinking mark,
which zone B never drew. Neither draws an entry with no text now (a
thinking mark, a message that ended empty, a notice with none), a rule
only between two drawn entries. Approved on 2026-10-24: 6 of 6 PASS
([`doc/plan40-evaluation.md`](doc/plan40-evaluation.md)); commit
4158751, then the approval commit.

## Plan 41 - No authorization on low-risk review rows

Brief amendment 42: a Codex auto-review row rated low risk read
"authorization unknown": Codex's reviewer answers a low-risk action with
a bare allow, and Codex then reports the authorization as unknown with a
stock rationale. After a preview, the owner chose to drop the
authorization from review rows rated low risk, in zone B, zone C's
timeline and the inspection; at medium, high and critical it stays.
Approved on 2026-10-24: 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan41-evaluation.md`](doc/plan41-evaluation.md)); commit
3904f13, then the approval commit.

## Plan 42 - The mouse in zone B: a click to fold, a double click to open

Brief amendment 43: beside the keyboard's path, which the owner approved
and which stays as it is, a click anywhere on a foldable item's row in
zone B (a run of calls, a thinking phase's summary row) unfolds it or
folds it again, and a double click on a row of an entry Enter shows whole
opens its full view as Enter does, an approval's rows the approval whole
as from its card. The mouse puts the entry cursor nowhere and shows none
of the keyboard's hints. On those rows a double click no longer selects a
word; a drag still does. Approved on 2026-10-24: 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan42-evaluation.md`](doc/plan42-evaluation.md)); commit
11f794d, then the approval commit.

## Plan 43 - A right activity sidebar with the Explorer docked

Brief amendment 44: a narrow activity sidebar right of zone B, from 100
columns, with the Explorer's and Skills' icons after the owner's two
images. The Explorer, a floating window since plan 17, is a panel docked
between zone B and the sidebar where zone B keeps 64 columns, and in zone
B's place where it does not and under 100 columns; F3 and the Explorer's
icon show and hide that one panel, the focus with it, F3 keeping its file
meaning. The icons' four looks are Sixel images, their hover from
every motion reported, filtered before Update; Skills is a placeholder.
The review led to a third patch of the vendored ultraviolet: a row
holding a wide character is written only as far as it changed, so the
icons beside it stay. Approved on 2026-10-25: 15 of 15 PASS
([`doc/plan43-evaluation.md`](doc/plan43-evaluation.md)); commit
48bde52, then the approval commit.

## Plan 44 - Source Control and a Git diff viewer

Brief amendment 45: the sidebar's second icon, Skills' placeholder until
then, is Source Control. Its panel shares the Explorer's docked place and
lists the project's Git changes from one git status read, the Explorer's
too: MERGE CHANGES, CHANGES and STAGED CHANGES, each file with its real
status, a file staged and changed again in both. A file opens its diff in
zone B's place, the panel beside it from 118 columns: git's blobs read raw
by cat-file and the working file, compared by a Myers diff of our own,
unified or side by side, with line numbers, green and red rows and
navigation between changes; read only. The engine was built by an
implementer subagent. Approved on 2026-10-25: 14 of 14 PASS
([`doc/plan44-evaluation.md`](doc/plan44-evaluation.md)); commit
d9d7d83, then the approval commit.

## Plan 45 - Commit, Push and Commit & Push in Source Control

Brief amendment 46: under Source Control's repository row, a message
field, a purple "✓ Commit" button with a separator and a chevron, and a
dropdown with one item, Commit & Push, after the owner's image. Commit
takes the index as staged (asking before staging anything), refuses a
staged set other than the one shown and counts once HEAD is a new commit
on the old one; Push goes to the configured upstream only, never forced;
the main action is read from git's branch line. After the first report
the owner asked for two additions: the staged files' contents compared
too, and a long operation's elapsed time with Esc cancelling a push (a
Ctrl+Break to git's own process group, behind a check of its lock files;
probes P45a to P45e). The engine's first version was built by an
implementer subagent. Approved on 2026-10-25: 19 of 19 PASS
([`doc/plan45-evaluation.md`](doc/plan45-evaluation.md)); commit
f71e022, then the approval commit.

## Plan 46 - Three fixes from the audit

Brief amendment 47: the first three fixes of the read-only audit of
2026-10-25 ([`doc/audit.md`](doc/audit.md)), each test-first.
- The worktree merge reads the main worktree first, refuses a merge in
  progress or uncommitted changes, and aborts only its own conflict
  (MERGE_HEAD the branch's tip).
- A refused Codex `config/read` or `model/list` no longer ends the
  handshake (`event.Problem.Optional`).
- An opened untracked folder in Source Control is read again after each
  status read and each opening.

Approved on 2026-10-25: 10 of 10 PASS
([`doc/plan46-evaluation.md`](doc/plan46-evaluation.md)); commit 9375233,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 47 - The rest of the audit's phase 1

Brief amendment 48: the rest of phase 1 of the audit's roadmap
([`doc/audit.md`](doc/audit.md), Part 2, C), each fix test-first.
- Ctrl+Q while a commit, push or staging runs asks to confirm, naming
  it.
- An answer to a request the CLI withdrew first expires the approval and
  the session goes on (`provider.ErrNoPending`).
- The reducer's Mode case returns, so mode events leave no false note,
  and a mock replay of Codex declines in Codex's word.
- The Explorer opened over the staging question drops it.
- `realPath` strips the `\\?\` prefix; two stale comments are corrected.
- `TestStateMachines`, failing since plan 46's commit, is repaired.

Approved on 2026-10-25: 10 of 10 PASS
([`doc/plan47-evaluation.md`](doc/plan47-evaluation.md)); commit d44bc0f,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 48 - The audit's phase 2: robustness at the boundaries

Brief amendment 49: phase 2 of the audit's roadmap
([`doc/audit.md`](doc/audit.md), Part 2, C), each fix test-first.
- The TIFF and ICO readers are bounded: the tags read from the file when
  used, an icon's PNG size checked before decoding.
- A running command's streamed output keeps its last 64 KiB, the rest
  counted and said.
- The Claude Code reader never writes to stdin.
- Git calls are bounded by `WaitDelay` once git has ended.
- A panic in the dashboard's own goroutines ends its session in order
  (`Fatal`, `Panicked`); fuzz targets for the image readers and both
  mappers.
- Bidi controls and zero-width spaces are drawn as `<U+XXXX>` on the
  approval card.

Approved on 2026-10-25: 13 of 14 PASS; 48.5 FAIL, its prediction about
the old code, accepted as a documented exception
([`doc/plan48-evaluation.md`](doc/plan48-evaluation.md)); commit 067aeb4,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 49 - The rest of phase 0, and phases 3 and 4 of the audit

Brief amendment 50: the rest of phase 0 of the audit's roadmap and its
phases 3 and 4 ([`doc/audit.md`](doc/audit.md), Part 2, C).
- Phase 0: the event queue's and the write queue's tests, and a matrix of
  the ten overlays alone and in their 90 ordered pairs.
- Tool rows memoised and long sessions' scans bounded (`render.Memo`,
  `State.ToolOrder`, `State.ParentRev`, zone A's rows made when shown);
  `TestToolsToFrame` joins the timing step.
- One owner of the overlays (`render.Layers`), the matrix's five defects
  fixed.
- The adapters' shared lifecycle (`pipe.Proc`).
- The git tests in parallel, git's environment set once in `TestMain`.
- Normalised approval decisions (`event.Decision`), each adapter writing
  its CLI's words byte for byte as before.
- Widths by grapheme cluster (`render/cluster.go`).
- A GIF's first frame alone decoded, its other frames walked by their
  blocks.

Approved on 2026-10-25: 11 of 16 PASS; 49.7 and 49.10, short of their
targets, and 49.8, 49.9 and 49.11, on tests that changed how they call
the code, FAIL, accepted as documented exceptions
([`doc/plan49-evaluation.md`](doc/plan49-evaluation.md)); commit 5c06d39,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 50 - Source Control multi-selection

Brief amendment 51: Ctrl+click selects files in Source Control, a "▎" on
each selected row and "Commit N files" on the button, and Commit and
Commit & Push commit them alone, by `git commit --only`: each selected
file staged whole, a partly staged one refused, unstaged and untracked
ones staged only after the question's yes, the rest of the index left as
it is. Windows Terminal passes Ctrl with a click, never Shift. The
owner's question before the approval of the plan: when the commit fails
after the question's staging, the staging stays, as git leaves it, and
the note says so. After the first evaluation (13 of 13 PASS) the owner
asked that a plain click on a file clear the selection, Commit being the
whole index as before with none selected, and that the note say
"changes"; the review of the complete diff then found a file moved on
disk, both its rows selected, refused once staged, fixed by reading
git's status path by path. Approved on 2026-10-26: 14 of 14 PASS
([`doc/plan50-evaluation.md`](doc/plan50-evaluation.md)); commit
b9f8323, then the approval commit.

## Plan 51 - Home screen redesign

Brief amendment 52: the home screen drawn as the owner's image,
`references/16-home-screen.webp`: picture mode (Sixel images, their text
by GDI in Cascadia Mono) from 118 columns with Sixel, grid mode otherwise;
the project field's path terminal text, its editing, selection, copy and
paste as before; an animated Space Invaders banner, ten frames a second,
only the pixels that change sent, in a fixed palette, paused without the
focus and hidden on small screens; Ctrl+N resets the form, the mouse
works the screen, Ctrl+P is left out. After the evaluation the owner
asked for a livelier pace, then twice for a faster ship (the march every
0.4 s, the ship's legs at 125 to 275 design pixels a second; a dash with
afterimages tried and withdrawn). Approved on 2026-10-27: 10 of 11 PASS
at the evaluation; 51.1, the field's box up to half a row from the
design's place, FAIL, accepted as a documented exception; 51.7 measured
again on a quiet machine, PASS; 51.9's paste back checked by the owner
([`doc/plan51-evaluation.md`](doc/plan51-evaluation.md)); commit
7e60f73, then the approval commit.

## Plan 52 - The system's folder dialog for the project

Brief amendment 53: the home screen's folder button and Ctrl+O open the
system's dialog for choosing a folder (IFileOpenDialog, folders only),
over the terminal, at the field's directory, else its nearest existing
parent, else the starting folder; the folder chosen goes into the field,
which takes the focus, Cancel changes nothing, a failure is a note. Plan
15's project browser removed at the owner's choice, `realPath` and
`dosPath` kept in `input/realpath_*.go`. Approved on 2026-10-27: 5 of 5
PASS ([`doc/plan52-evaluation.md`](doc/plan52-evaluation.md)); commit
9b8b6e5, then the approval commit.

## Plan 53 - A project chosen in the list fills the field

Brief amendment 54: choosing a project in the home screen's PROJECTS
list, by up and down or a click on its row or star, puts its path into
the Project directory field, so that the field shows what Start uses;
Tab onto the list, f and Del leave the field as it is. Approved on
2026-10-27: 5 of 5 PASS
([`doc/plan53-evaluation.md`](doc/plan53-evaluation.md)); commit
1818367, then the approval commit, both pushed.

## Plan 54 - The mouse wheel over the project list

Brief amendment 55: the wheel over the home screen's PROJECTS panel, its
rows, headings and frame, moves the list's selection one project a notch,
as up and down do, choosing it (its path into the field) and giving the
list the focus; the panel's other cells carry `HomeItemList`. Approved on
2026-10-27: 4 of 4 PASS
([`doc/plan54-evaluation.md`](doc/plan54-evaluation.md)); commit
38ee6d7, then the approval commit, both pushed.

## Plan 55 - Nerd Font icons in the Explorer

Brief amendment 56: in the acc tab, with Cascadia Mono NF installed for
the owner (release 2407.24, per user, registered from Windows Terminal:
the Claude app's shells write the registry into its private copy), the
Explorer's rows draw Nerd Font icons in each kind's colour and the
codicons' chevrons; anywhere else (another terminal or profile, no font,
a terminal started before it) the panel's own glyphs. The launcher names
the face in the acc tab's fragment by the same rule. Approved on
2026-10-27: 5 PASS, 0 FAIL, and 55.5's visual review by the owner
([`doc/plan55-evaluation.md`](doc/plan55-evaluation.md)); commit
374c23e, then the approval commit, both pushed.

## Plan 56 - The Explorer's font installed by acc

Brief amendments 57 and 59: Cascadia Mono NF bundled in the repository as
released (`third_party/fonts`, the SIL OFL 1.1 with its symbols'
notices) and installed by acc for the user, under Windows Terminal, when
Windows has no font of that name: the files checked against
`SHA256SUMS`, registered under HKCU, one line printed; a failure one
line, the launch going on; plan 55's rule unchanged, the icons from
Terminal's next start. Withdrawn on 2026-10-28 for plan 57 and reinstated
the same day. Approved on 2026-10-28 without repeating its end-to-end
test, run with the owner on 2026-10-27: 6 PASS, 0 FAIL
([`doc/plan56-evaluation.md`](doc/plan56-evaluation.md)); commit
d88c392, then the approval commit, both pushed; its full text in git
(`git show d88c392:plan.md`).

## Plan 57 - Segoe Fluent Icons in the Explorer

Brief amendment 58: the Explorer's icons from Segoe Fluent Icons, a font
that comes with Windows 11, named after Cascadia Mono in the acc tab's
face, nothing to install. Proposed on 2026-10-28 and withdrawn by the
owner the same day without being implemented (amendment 59), for plan
56's Nerd Font icons and the same look on any Windows version; its
proposal in git (`git show d88c392:plan.md`).

## Plan 58 - A click outside the window closes it

Brief amendment 60: a left click outside the window floating over the
dashboard, the file viewer or the quick open, closes it as Esc's last step
does and does nothing else, the click judged against the frame drawn last
(`Screen.Window`); full screen, its first row is outside; the draft
window keeps its rule. Approved on 2026-10-28: 5 PASS, 0 FAIL
([`doc/plan58-evaluation.md`](doc/plan58-evaluation.md)); commit
0408228, then the approval commit, both pushed; its full text in git
(`git show 0408228:plan.md`).

## Plan 59 - The branches popup

Brief amendment 61: a click on the project bar's branch name, or Alt+B,
opens a popup of the repository's branches and tags: a search, Recent,
Local, Remote and Tags, a message where a group is empty; a switch (git
switch, a remote branch as a tracking one), confirmed when uncommitted
changes would come along and refused while the agent works, a notice in
zone B and a note in an empty draft after it; a fetch of every remote,
never pruning, Esc and a two-minute limit stopping it; a name copied; the
header's branch following the HEAD file, checked every 2 s. New branch
left out by the owner. Approved on 2026-10-28: 10 PASS, 0 FAIL after the
owner's visual review ([`doc/plan59-evaluation.md`](doc/plan59-evaluation.md));
commit 5c8c9be, then the approval commit, both pushed; its full text in
git (`git show 5c8c9be:plan.md`).
