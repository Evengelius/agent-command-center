# Current Plan

The active plan with its progress, the owner's standing decisions, and one
entry per closed plan. Each plan comes from `doc/brief.md` and its
amendments, ends with the evaluation summary of `doc/evaluation.md`, and
waits for the owner's approval before the next one starts. This file keeps
the current state only (the owner, 2026-10-18): a closed plan's full text,
criteria and progress log are in git (`git show 8888f59:plan.md` for plans 1
to 13, `git show 84d2ad8:plan.md` for plan 14, `git show b047434:plan.md`
for plan 15, `git show becfb34:plan.md` for plan 16, `git show f00c2d8:plan.md`
for plan 17, `git show 8b3b16b:plan.md` for plan 18, `git show
d84e5d4:plan.md` for plan 20, `git show f939d96:plan.md` for plan 21,
`git show d13ef71:plan.md` for plan 22, `git show e8d3e3b:plan.md` for

for plan 25, `git show a9a5145:plan.md` for plan 26, `git show 041e7b8:plan.md`
for plan 27, `git show 8fe0077:plan.md` for plan 28, `git show d696f22:plan.md`
for plan 29, `git show 6025513:plan.md` for plan 30, `git show
8e2a721:plan.md` for plan 31, `git show b56d23e:plan.md` for plan 32, `git show
bc5d92b:plan.md` for plan 33, `git show 47b50ce:plan.md` for plan 34, `git show
b43cf46:plan.md` for plan 35, `git show c0cebc4:plan.md` for plan 36), and its
results in its evaluation file.

## The owner's standing decisions

Decisions of closed plans that still apply; `AGENTS.md` and
`doc/evaluation.md` hold the others.

- **Live runs.** Each one is proposed first with its scope, model, expected
  usage and stopping conditions, and runs only once approved (plan 3,
  2026-10-16); Claude runs use Haiku as a per-process override.
- **The configuration check is hash-only**: credential contents are never
  read, and a file that cannot be classified safely is "changed, not
  classified", never reported unchanged (2026-10-16). No parser runs over a
  file that may hold credentials (the mixed-state tokenizer was withdrawn,
  2026-10-16); the one exception is confcheck's key-level comparison of
  `~/.claude.json`, sensitive keys skipped (plan 5).
- **Measured, not assumed.** Performance figures are targets until a test
  measures them; a documented design is never presented as verified runtime
  behaviour (2026-10-16).
- **The integration.** If driving a CLI without a terminal falls short, the
  limit is documented and the smallest adjustment proposed; the architecture
  never changes silently (2026-10-16).
- **Drafts and session data** survive cancellation, crashes and recovery; no
  conversation data is stored beyond the draft, and nothing sensitive goes
  into a log (2026-10-16).
- **Zone A shows values, not notes** (amendment 25, 2026-10-22, plan 26):
  its telemetry pane carries no notes row, legend or counter, now or in
  any later plan; errors, retries, unrecognised lines, freshness and the
  legends live in the details view (Enter on TELEMETRY), where each value
  has its source and age. An undocumented value keeps its "†" mark where
  it is shown.

## Recurring

Tasks tagged **[Recurring]** repeat on an outside event: they are never
closed, never listed as remaining, and each occurrence is reported in the
summary format (the owner, 2026-10-18).

- **[Recurring] After a CLI update.** At session start, `claude --version`
  and `codex --version` are compared with the "Last probed" line of
  `doc/research/probes/README.md`; a newer one is told to the owner with the
  re-check proposed (`doc/evaluation.md`, After a CLI update), which runs
  only once the owner approves it. The dashboard's project bar shows
  "newer than tested" meanwhile. Last occurrence: Claude Code 2.1.303 on
  2026-10-19, approved, every check PASS (P303a to P303d in
  `doc/research/probes/README.md`); it found that plan 14's shape check
  counted an interrupted tool use as unrecognised, fixed the same day at the
  owner's request (P303e).

## Nice to have

Items tagged **[Nice to have]** are future improvements: none is built, and
none is listed as remaining, until the owner asks for one in a new plan
(the owner, 2026-10-18). Amendment 4 names ten "future improvements"
(`doc/brief.md`, Amendment 4, "For this phase, do NOT implement"). Five
remain below. Recent projects, favourites and a project browser were plan 15
(amendment 9); git worktree management was plan 16 (amendment 10). The
automatic VS Code integration was replaced by the owner with a file viewer in
the terminal, plan 17 (amendment 11). The session's model, effort and
Ultracode selection was plan 34 (amendment 34); configuring models beyond the
session stays below.

- **[Nice to have]** Advanced model configuration.
- **[Nice to have]** Cross-provider agent collaboration.
- **[Nice to have]** Provider switching during an active session.
- **[Nice to have]** Complex session profiles.
- **[Nice to have]** Advanced orchestration configuration.
- **[Nice to have]** Google Antigravity as an agent CLI, removed from the
  MVP by amendment 5; the provider interface stays open to it.
- **[Nice to have]** Starting it like an app (the owner, 2026-10-19): a built
  `agent-command-center.exe` started from a Start-menu shortcut, pinnable to
  the taskbar, whose target is `wt.exe -d <projects folder> <path to the
  .exe>`, so that it always opens in Windows Terminal (the only supported
  terminal, amendments 6 and 7) with the project field at that folder; the
  `.exe` is rebuilt after each code change.

## Plan 37 - The effort slider after the owner's images

Brief amendment 38 (2026-10-24): the selector's effort dropdown replaced
by one pill-shaped slider of discrete levels after the owner's five
images, and the Effort and Ultracode rows laid on shared columns: label,
description, control. The criteria below were written before the code,
the slider's image excepted, written for the probe; nothing is committed
until the owner has reviewed the result.

### What the probe found

- The images, measured (brief amendment 38): an 8:1 pill, a white thumb
  0.944 of its height, the levels evenly spaced from one end's centre to
  the other's, 4x4 dots, a fill of `#6784C1` at each of the four lower
  levels, and at the highest a gradient over the whole pill with specks.
- `internal/render/slider.go` (`SliderImage`), drawn in Windows Terminal
  1.23 at one row, 16 cells (160x20 pixels, the images' 8:1), beside each
  image scaled to that row (`scratchpad\plan37\probe-wt.png`): geometry,
  dots, fill and gradient match at the five levels; six and four levels,
  a held effort, a ring round a level asked for, and none known drawn
  too. The lowest level showed a sliver of fill at the thumb's left
  edge, which the first image has not: removed.
- The images keep one fill colour below the highest level; what grows is
  the filled length, as the owner's own captions say ("approximately
  half the track is filled", "most of the track becomes filled"). The
  slider does the same, and lights the whole pill only at the highest.

### Design

- **D1. The image.** 17 cells, 170x20 pixels: the pill in the first 16,
  the band's last cell after it (plan 35, design D2). Track `#272B2D`,
  ends of radius 10; the model's levels evenly spaced from one end's
  centre to the other's (x 10 to 150); a dot 2.3 pixels across at each,
  `#697276` on the track, `#95A9D4` on the fill, pale lavender on the
  gradient; the thumb a white disc 18.9 pixels across; below the
  highest level a fill of `#6784C1` from the left end to the thumb's
  centre, none at the lowest; at the highest level (the model's last
  one: Max for Claude Code's, Ultra for a Codex model that lists it) the
  whole pill lit by the gradient, with 11 specks; a white ring round a
  level asked for and not yet in force; greyed while a variable holds
  the effort; dots alone while no level is known. On the band, the
  band's colour around the pill and in the last cell; elsewhere
  transparent outside the pill. Drawn with Sixel as the toggle is: the
  frame keeps the 17 cells blank on the ground in every state; the
  application draws the image once the frame is out, the cells written
  first, in one synchronized output.
- **D2. Without Sixel**, 16 text cells: Powerline's half circles at the
  ends, the cells between on the track's or the fill's ground (at the
  highest level, the gradient's, cell by cell), a "·" at each level, the
  thumb two white half circles, a level asked for "○"; greyed while
  held.
- **D3. The rows.** Effort and Ultracode on three shared columns: the
  label at column 3, "Effort (<level>)" in the style of Ultracode's
  label ("Effort (N/A)" when the model lists no level or none is
  known); the description, muted, at column 3 plus the longest label of
  the session's models' levels and "Ultracode" plus 2 (column 20 for
  Claude Code's, "Effort (Medium)"): "Controls reasoning depth",
  "Enables dynamic workflows"; the controls' right ends at column W-4,
  the slider's pill in W-19 to W-4, the toggle's in W-7 to W-4. The box
  widens to hold them: the description column, the longest description,
  2, 16 and 3 (66 for Claude Code's, from 63); the model list and More
  models unchanged. A model with no levels has no slider.
- **D4. Choosing.** The slider's cells carry the nearest level: a click
  there asks for it. With the cursor on Effort, ← and → ask for the
  level before or after the one shown, a level asked for that waits
  counting as shown; nothing past the ends; Enter and Space do nothing
  there. A held effort says why in zone B and asks nothing (unchanged).
  The cursor follows the pointer onto the slider as onto any row (plan
  36). The dropdown, its list and their keys go.
- **D5. What the thumb shows** is the level in force, as the CLI reports
  it, never a choice not yet confirmed, which is ringed. When the level
  in force changes while the slider shows, the thumb glides to it in
  180 ms, eased, drawn every 30 ms, its fill and colour with it; the
  label changes with the frame, the glide's clock running from that
  frame, so that the image's first drawing, 50 ms later once the frame
  is out, is already on its way. Amended after a burst in Windows
  Terminal: with the clock from the first drawing, that drawing showed
  the old level and the thumb began to move about 100 ms after the label.
- **D6. Unchanged:** the model list, More models, the Ultracode toggle's
  look and behaviour (its description moves to the shared column), the
  model pill on the editor row.

### Criteria

Checked by tests unless marked WT (Windows Terminal).

1. The image: 170x20 pixels; on the ground, transparent outside the
   pill and opaque inside; with 5 levels, the thumb white at x 10, 45,
   80, 115 and 150; the fill `#6784C1` from the left end to the thumb at
   the second to fourth levels, none at the lowest; the other levels'
   dots `#697276` on the track and `#95A9D4` on the fill; at the
   highest, the gradient (`#4C3F99` at the left end, `#B2..` near 45%)
   and specks; 6 levels: the sixth lit, the fifth blue; 4 levels: the
   fourth lit; held: greyed; asked: a white ring; none known: no
   thumb; on the band: the band's colour around the pill and in the
   last 10 columns.
2. With Sixel, the Effort row's columns W-19 to W-3 are blank cells on
   the ground, the same with the cursor on the row or not from W-19 to
   the box's edge; each pill cell carries its nearest level; the frame
   reports the slider's place and look.
3. Without Sixel, the 16 cells read as D2 at each level, a level asked
   for and a held effort.
4. The columns, Claude Code at 80x24, 120x40 and 200x60: "Effort (" and
   "Ultracode" at column 3; "Controls reasoning depth" and "Enables
   dynamic workflows" both at column 20 at every level shown; the
   slider's pill and the toggle's ending at W-4; the box 66 wide, the
   model rows' text where it was. Codex: the same columns, no Ultracode.
5. Only the model's levels: Fable 5.1 five, Opus 4.6 four, Haiku 4.5
   none (no slider, "Effort (N/A)"), GPT-6-Sol six with Ultra lit.
6. ← and → on Effort ask for the adjacent level, from the one in force
   or the one waiting; nothing past the ends; Enter and Space nothing; a
   click on a pill cell asks for its level; a held effort asks nothing
   and says why; on other rows ← and → close the selector and go on.
7. The image drawn after the frame; a change of the level in force
   draws it again gliding, the drawings between at positions between
   the two levels, the last on the new; its place written over when the
   selector closes.
8. No regression: build, vet, gofmt clean; the suite; the race detector
   on render and app; golden frames changed only in the selector's box
   (its width and the two settings rows), each reviewed; the F1
   overlay's keys as ui-design.md's; `TestSelectorToFrame` within target.
9. WT, the Claude Code mock maximised and at 120x40: every level of Fable
   5.1 (5) and Opus 4.6 (4), on and off the band, beside the owner's
   images; the two rows' columns; the Codex mock: GPT-6-Sol's six; the
   glide caught in a burst.

### Steps

1. Probe (done 2026-10-24): the findings above; brief amendment 38.
2. The rows, the slider's cells and text, the input, the glide.
3. Tests, golden frames, the checks; WT; the evaluation
   (`doc/plan37-evaluation.md`); the docs; the report.

### Progress

- 2026-10-24: step 1 done; step 2 in progress.
- 2026-10-24: steps 2 and 3 done: the shared columns, the slider's
  cells, text and image, ← → and the clicks, the glide (D5 amended after
  a burst), the tests, the golden frames, the checks, WT at every level;
  the evaluation, `doc/plan37-evaluation.md`, 9 criteria: 9 PASS; the
  docs. Nothing committed: waiting for the owner's review.

reference projects, and the decision to build rather than fork
(`doc/research/`). Accepted on 2026-10-16, 9 PASS and criteria 8 and 9 kept as
FAIL, documented exceptions
([`doc/research/plan1-evaluation.md`](doc/research/plan1-evaluation.md));

The MVP, steps 0 to 8: startup, Claude Code, the streaming conversation,
approvals and resumption, Codex, agent activity, telemetry, the UI.
Approved on 2026-10-17 after a live demo on both CLIs, 14 of 14 PASS
([`doc/plan4-evaluation.md`](doc/plan4-evaluation.md)); commits ded53d8 to
cf58739.

## Plan 5 - Post-MVP improvements

The list plan 4 left open, Windows only. Approved on 2026-10-17, 17 of 17

897f640, 6813c0e.

## Plan 6 - Plan 5's known limits

Four known limits fixed, then items 5 and 6 added by the owner. Approved on
2026-10-17, 6 of 6 and 8 of 8 PASS
([`doc/plan6-evaluation.md`](doc/plan6-evaluation.md)); commits df273fe,
0814d67.

## Plan 7 - The open list after plan 6

The open list cleaned. Approved on 2026-10-17, 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan7-evaluation.md`](doc/plan7-evaluation.md)); commit bffe9a5.

## Plan 8 - Codex's allow for the session

`acceptForSession` on Codex 0.163.0. Approved on 2026-10-17, 6 of 6 PASS
and its follow-up 3 of 3 ([`doc/plan8-evaluation.md`](doc/plan8-evaluation.md));
commits e75d591, 1daeec1.

## Plan 9 - Plan 8's items left not verified

Two items verified, the third recorded as not verifiable. Approved on
2026-10-18, 6 of 6 PASS
([`doc/plan9-evaluation.md`](doc/plan9-evaluation.md)); commits
c9576d9, 8dea129.

## Plan 10 - A spawned Codex agent's label and the timing step

Both items verified. Approved on 2026-10-18, 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan10-evaluation.md`](doc/plan10-evaluation.md)); commits b71c114,
621609e.

## Plan 11 - A live approval offering the allow for the session

The live approval closed as not verifiable, by the owner's choice.
Approved on 2026-10-18, 3 of 3 PASS
([`doc/plan11-evaluation.md`](doc/plan11-evaluation.md)); commits 81f3bf8,
cb206b6.

## Plan 12 - Manual or Auto approvals

Brief amendment 8: a per-session switch between Manual and each CLI's own
Auto. Approved on 2026-10-18, 18 of 19 PASS and 1 FAIL accepted
([`doc/plan12-evaluation.md`](doc/plan12-evaluation.md)); commits cb31557,
83fa023.

## Plan 13 - A reviewer's refusal live

Claude Code's classifier denial seen live and a render defect it exposed
fixed; Codex's reviewer not reached, closed by the owner. Approved on
2026-10-18, 14 PASS and 3 not observed
([`doc/plan13-evaluation.md`](doc/plan13-evaluation.md));
commits d68bb55, 8888f59.

## Plan 14 - Nothing left open

Every open question of the research files settled or closed by the owner,
Claude Code's question card built and seen live, the documents reduced to
the latest state and a CLI update made visible. Approved on 2026-10-18, 18
PASS and 15 PASS ([`doc/plan14-evaluation.md`](doc/plan14-evaluation.md));
commits 0206ac1, ce06b97.

## Plan 15 - Recent projects, favourites and a project browser

Brief amendment 9: the startup screen's project list (`projects.json`,
favourites first) and its Ctrl+O browser. Approved on 2026-10-18, 21 PASS
([`doc/plan15-evaluation.md`](doc/plan15-evaluation.md)); commits bd9ffa3,
b047434.

## Plan 16 - Git worktree management

Brief amendment 10: the Worktrees view (Ctrl+W, at startup and in session)
with create, list, diff, merge and remove, git through `os/exec`. Approved
on 2026-10-18, 26 PASS
([`doc/plan16-evaluation.md`](doc/plan16-evaluation.md)); commits ce95ba2,
fad6d20, 642c5b9, becfb34.

## Plan 17 - A file viewer in the terminal

Brief amendments 11, 12 and 13: a file viewer in the terminal with Chroma's
highlighting, an Explorer of the project (F3) and the draft in a window
(Ctrl+G), with no external editor. Approved on 2026-10-19, 91 PASS
([`doc/plan17-evaluation.md`](doc/plan17-evaluation.md)); commits 1748808,
10c3e74, 904f9a6, 749cef4.

## Plan 18 - An adaptive layout

Brief amendment 14: zone C sized by the agents in play, a strip of 4 rows (3
under 100 columns) when there are none, and cleared at each new prompt.
Approved on 2026-10-19, 22 PASS
([`doc/plan18-evaluation.md`](doc/plan18-evaluation.md)); commit 8b3b16b.

## Plan 19 - Zone B as the centerpiece

Brief amendment 15: one speaker label per exchange, RESULT over an
exchange's outcome, compact tool rows and folds of long runs of calls, each
entry's turn (`Entry.Stage`). Done on 2026-10-20, 19 PASS
([`doc/plan19-evaluation.md`](doc/plan19-evaluation.md)). The owner
reviewed it in a demo the same day and asked for plan 20 (amendment 16),
which keeps its logic and replaces its look; not committed on its own, it
was committed with plan 20 once the owner approved that, on 2026-10-20;
commit d84e5d4.

## Plan 20 - Strict conformance to the approved templates

Brief amendments 16 and 17: the owner's two templates as one design
system, A and B in one upper row and C full width under them, zone B's
messages as blocks with a rule between them, the tool rows, the folds, the
pending approval's pink box and RESULT. Approved on 2026-10-20 after the
owner's live review, 32 of 32 PASS
([`doc/plan20-evaluation.md`](doc/plan20-evaluation.md)); commit d84e5d4,
with plan 19.

## Plan 21 - What the review of d84e5d4 found

A read-only review of commit d84e5d4: zone D's session time past 2,000
events, two timed tests outside the timing step, Claude Code's
undocumented `api_message_id` labelled with a fallback, zone C's floor at
160x24 to 160x26, and documents promising what the code did not do (the
send and newline keys built in `config.json`, the others corrected).
Approved on 2026-10-20 with the recommended choices, 38 PASS and 2 FAIL,
then the long session's frame time fixed at the owner's request, 6 PASS
([`doc/plan21-evaluation.md`](doc/plan21-evaluation.md)); commits bdc4250,
f939d96.

## Plan 22 - A live thinking indicator

Brief amendments 18 to 20: zone B's live thinking card for Claude Code and
Codex, with its animations, a summary row for each thinking phase that
opens on its details, and an activity line while a turn works; corrections
C1 to C12 from a read-only investigation
([`doc/plan22-investigation.md`](doc/plan22-investigation.md)); Codex
started through the local proxy that `config.json` names (amendment 19);
Codex's reasoning summaries asked for and Claude Code's hook events known
(amendment 20), checked live with one Codex turn (L20). Approved on
2026-10-21: 31 of 31 PASS, then the corrections 17 of 18 with 5.14 fixed,
amendment 20 13 of 13, and L20 8 of 8 once two criteria were corrected
([`doc/plan22-evaluation.md`](doc/plan22-evaluation.md)); commits
e6895c6, 6306bfb and d13ef71, then the approval commit.

## Plan 23 - The acc launcher in the project

Brief amendment 21: `acc`, typed in Windows Terminal, opens the dashboard
in a tab of its own at the owner's size, a 9 pt font. `acc.cmd` at the root
runs `scripts\acc.ps1`, which writes a Terminal fragment for the profile
and makes Terminal reload. The day's machine-local changes were undone.
Approved on 2026-10-22, 6 of 6 PASS before the commit, then committed and
pushed ([`doc/plan23-evaluation.md`](doc/plan23-evaluation.md)); commit
e8d3e3b, then the approval commit.

## Plan 24 - Zone A with the telemetry, zone D removed

Brief amendment 22: zone A redrawn after the owner's image, holding the
orchestrator's dynamic status, the stages as blocks and zone D's telemetry
(session usage, quota windows with lavender bars and countdowns, the notes,
the details view); zone D removed; Fable and Mythos as model families.
Amendment 23, after the owner's live session: the Claude adapter reads the
`/usage` report after the handshake and after each turn, so the
model-scoped "Fable limit" shows live, the exchange kept out of the
conversation. Approved on 2026-10-22: 35 of 35 PASS with the conformance
table 22 rows PASS, amendment 23 6 of 6 and its live check 8 of 8
([`doc/plan24-evaluation.md`](doc/plan24-evaluation.md)); commits 6209267
and a3bfe5d, then the approval commit.

## Plan 25 - The unrecognised lines named

Brief amendment 24: the owner's scenario 1 run on Fable 5.1 ended with
"unrecognised 2" and no way to see which lines. The details view now lists
the last 20 unrecognised lines with their time, type, reason and text; a
replay tool names them from a logging wrapper's record; the owner's two,
named by a logged rerun, were `system/task_summary`, known with no event
since. Approved on 2026-10-22: 7 of 7 PASS, two live runs
([`doc/plan25-evaluation.md`](doc/plan25-evaluation.md)); commit cb8f76d,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 26 - Zone A without notes

Brief amendment 25: the owner asked to get rid of zone A's notes
("unrecognised 1", "quota updated", "† undocumented field", "cost at API
rates") completely and forever. The telemetry pane now ends with the last
quota window's rows; the counts, ages and legends live in the details view,
where an undocumented value keeps its "†" and the heading explains it; a
standing decision. Approved on 2026-10-22: 6 of 6 PASS, 51 golden frames
reviewed ([`doc/plan26-evaluation.md`](doc/plan26-evaluation.md)); commit
a9a5145, then the approval commit.

## Plan 27 - Zone C with the execution timeline

Brief amendments 26 and 27: the owner's design of zone C and its
close-ups, to respect strictly. Zone C from 100 columns: the header
inside the frame, a rule and the panels' line in the title colour, the
agents' panel as wide as its two-column cards (the label over the clock
and the tokens, a grey bar, the model over the current tool; the selected
agent's rows on a band) and the selected agent's execution timeline with
its status at the heading's right end; the narrow layout keeps plan 18's
row. Approved on 2026-10-22: 15 of 16 PASS, 27.6 corrected with a note
at the owner's decision, 46 golden frames, Windows Terminal screenshots
at 208x59 and 120x40 against the images
([`doc/plan27-evaluation.md`](doc/plan27-evaluation.md)); commit 041e7b8,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 28 - The top right after the owner's image

Brief amendment 28: the owner's close-up of the top right, "● LIVE" over
"Claude Code 2.1.303" over zone B's edge with "Idle". The project bar's
right end is the provider's name and version alone while approvals are
Manual with no change asked; the mode shows there only as Auto or while
changing. Approved on 2026-10-22: 6 of 6 PASS, 27 golden frames, a
Windows Terminal screenshot against the image
([`doc/plan28-evaluation.md`](doc/plan28-evaluation.md)); commit 8fe0077,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 29 - The input editor's row after the owner's image

Brief amendment 29: the owner's image of the editor's row, design only.
Under the draft a separator, then " + " and the pill " <model> High ·
Ultracode " on the tool rows' ground, the editor's messages and the line
count in the free middle, "↯ Auto" at the right end; the "+", "High ·
Ultracode" and "Auto" are placeholders with no function. Zone B is one
row shorter. Approved on 2026-10-22: 7 of 7 PASS, 59 golden frames,
Windows Terminal screenshots at 208x59 and 120x40 against the image
([`doc/plan29-evaluation.md`](doc/plan29-evaluation.md)); commit d696f22,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 30 - The "+" menu after the owner's image

Brief amendment 30: the owner's image of the "+" clicked, design first. A
click on the editor row's band opens a three-row box above the editor's
rule, "🗀  Upload from computer", the band and the item under the
pointer on the active ground (`#272745`), the terminal asked for every
mouse motion only while it is open; Esc, any key or a click elsewhere
closes it; the item does nothing yet, the upload being a later plan's.
Approved on 2026-10-22: 6 of 6 PASS, four golden frames added, Windows
Terminal screenshots with a real click and pointer moves at 208x59 and
120x40 against the image
([`doc/plan30-evaluation.md`](doc/plan30-evaluation.md)); commit 6025513,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 31 - Image upload

Brief amendment 31: the "+" menu's "Upload from computer" works. The
system's Open dialog, several images at once, each checked by its bytes
(PNG, JPEG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, ICO and WebP accepted, the orientation
applied, conversions to PNG, an image over a provider's limits scaled
down and said so; HEIC, AVIF, JPEG XL, JPEG 2000, PSD, TGA, DDS, HDR,
EXR, camera raws and SVG refused by name); chips under the editor's
rule, removable; sent only when the owner submits, as base64 image
blocks to Claude Code and `image` inputs holding data URLs to Codex, no
event keeping the bytes (Codex writes them back). Approved on
2026-10-23: 9 of 9 PASS, eight golden frames added, the real dialog in
Windows Terminal, live turns on Claude Code (Haiku 5.5) and Codex
(gpt-6-sol) naming the colours and the text, and a third on Codex
checking the echo fix
([`doc/plan31-evaluation.md`](doc/plan31-evaluation.md)); commit 8e2a721,
then the approval commit.

## Plan 32 - Image paste and preview

Brief amendment 32: paste an image as in the owner's chat, and a preview
before sending. Alt+V attaches the clipboard's images (copied files, the
"PNG" format's bytes, else the bitmap as PNG); Ctrl+V pastes text as
before and, when Windows Terminal keeps its press for want of text,
attaches the image on the key's lone release (undocumented, probe P32a);
a paste of the copied files' paths attaches them when all are images;
a pasted image is held in memory only. With Sixel graphics, the images
show as thumbnails between the rule and the chips, rounded squares cut
from their centre, 14x7 cells from 50 rows, 10x5 from 30, side by side
one cell apart (the owner's remark on the screenshots), drawn after the
frame and again after any frame that changes their rows, a vacated
place written over with the frame's cells. Approved on 2026-10-23: 10 of
10 PASS, four golden frames added, Windows Terminal at 208x59 and
120x40 with the owner's clipboard saved and restored, the remark in a
follow-up ([`doc/plan32-evaluation.md`](doc/plan32-evaluation.md));
commit b56d23e, then the approval commit.

## Plan 33 - Unsent drafts and images through crashes and restarts

Brief amendment 33: whether unsent image attachments survive a crash, a
forced termination, a restart and a resumed session; an investigation
first, then its nine corrections. Each dashboard's draft has a folder of
its own, its lock held while the dashboard owns it, taken back by the
project's next start (its own CLI's first, then the newest); images are
saved at once, the text every 500 ms; pasted images are kept as
`<sha256>.png` until their message is accepted; a message waiting for
its acceptance is stored with what was typed since; Back forgets the
attachments; a damaged list is set aside; a changed file is attached
again as it is now; refused renames and failed saves are tried again;
unused files are swept at each start. An independent review found five
defects, fixed; on the owner's questions, a Codex session resumed with
images, a slow and an offline share were simulated, fixed where they
lost data, and a logoff was not simulated. Approved on 2026-10-23: 14 of
14 PASS and the follow-up
([`doc/plan33-evaluation.md`](doc/plan33-evaluation.md)); commit
bc5d92b, then the approval commit.

## Plan 34 - The model selector, its effort and Ultracode

Brief amendment 34: a click on the editor row's model pill, or Alt+P,
opens the active CLI's own models with the effort and, for Claude Code,
Ultracode, after the owner's image. Claude Code's list comes from
`initialize`, its changes go by `set_model` and `apply_flag_settings`
and are read back by the undocumented `get_settings`; Codex's list from
every page of `model/list`, its changes ride the next `turn/start`,
read back by `thread/read`. The screen shows a value only once the CLI
reports it in force; an effort held by `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` is
shown and never changed; Claude Code's changes wait for a turn's end. An
independent review found four defects and six doubts, fixed, and three
small points on its second pass. At the owner's request
`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` was removed from their Claude Code settings,
and the dashboard then set the effort live; amendment 35, an opt-in line
telling the agent its settings, was built and withdrawn. Approved on
2026-10-24: 20 of 21 PASS, 34.18 (golden frames changed beyond the
pill's values) accepted
([`doc/plan34-evaluation.md`](doc/plan34-evaluation.md)); commit
47b50ce, then the approval commit.

## Plan 35 - The Ultracode toggle after the owner's image

Brief amendment 36: the owner's image of the Ultracode toggle, a lavender
pill with fully rounded ends and a round white knob, against the
dashboard's `▐   ●▌`. Where the terminal draws Sixel, the toggle is an
image over blank cells of its row, drawn as the preview's thumbnails are:
a pill of 40x20 pixels in an image of five cells whose last carries the
band, since the renderer writes every cell between a row's first and last
changes and a band cell after the image made it blink when the band came
or went (bursts of captures in Windows Terminal); without Sixel, a text
pill of Powerline's half circles. Approved on 2026-10-24: 8 of 8 PASS
([`doc/plan35-evaluation.md`](doc/plan35-evaluation.md)); commit
b43cf46, then the approval commit.

## Plan 36 - The selector's cursor and a pointer that has not moved

Brief amendment 37: Alt+P could reopen the model selector with its
cursor on the row under a resting pointer, so that Enter acted on that
row. The probe (Bubble Tea's `TEA_TRACE`) showed Windows Terminal
reporting a pointer put down by software, without its moving, once the
selector asked for every motion, its reports wandering a cell. The
selector now moves its cursor only when the pointer comes onto another
row than the last report's, the first report after Alt+P only recording
where it rests. Approved on 2026-10-24: 7 of 7 PASS
([`doc/plan36-evaluation.md`](doc/plan36-evaluation.md)); commit
c0cebc4, then the approval commit.
