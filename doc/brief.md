I want to build a personal, native terminal dashboard for Claude Code multi-agent workflows.

**My goal:** Create a terminal-based command center inspired by the video and screenshot in `references/`. I love its dark, technical aesthetic, colored workflow diagrams, animated progress indicators, and hierarchical visualization of agents.

Before writing any code, research these existing implementations:

- https://github.com/bjornjee/agent-dashboard
- https://github.com/seunggabi/claude-dashboard
- https://github.com/jedarden/ccdash
- https://github.com/Akramovic1/jev-pilot
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/workflows
- https://code.claude.com/docs/en/statusline

**Phase 1 — Research**

Inspect their architectures, implementation approaches, dependencies, licensing, and relevant source code.

Identify which components we can reuse and which should be built ourselves. Determine whether forking an existing repository is preferable to starting from scratch.

Do not assume that the video represents an existing working application.

**Phase 2 — Architecture**

Design a native terminal application with three primary areas:

1. Left: orchestrator, workflow tree, phase status, and agent hierarchy.
2. Main: live subagent activity, execution logs, progress, agent selection, and diff inspection.
3. Bottom: real 5-hour and 7-day subscription quota, reset timers, token usage, context consumption, model information, and agent statistics.

Prefer Bubble Tea, Lip Gloss, and tmux unless your research identifies a better solution.

Reuse Claude Code's native orchestration wherever possible. Do not rebuild its workflow engine unnecessarily.

Support keyboard navigation, live updates, responsive terminal layouts, and a polished visual style inspired by the reference.

**Phase 3 — Reliability**

- Use officially documented interfaces where possible.
- Separate the data collection layer from the interface.
- Handle unavailable telemetry gracefully.
- Keep existing Claude Code configurations intact.
- Treat JEV routing as optional, not a prerequisite.
- Provide mock-data mode for visual development.
- Implement tests for telemetry parsing and agent state transitions.

**Phase 4 — Proposal**

Before implementing anything, provide:

1. A comparison of the reference projects.
2. A recommended architecture and technology stack.
3. A detailed terminal UI design.
4. A prioritized MVP roadmap.
5. A list of what can be reused versus developed.
6. Technical risks and compatibility constraints.

Do not edit files or install dependencies yet. Present the research and proposed plan, then wait for my approval.

My priority is a beautiful, functional, personalized terminal experience — not creating another complex orchestration framework.

## Amendment, 2026-10-15: not only Claude Code

The owner: "it must work with Codex or Gemini also, it's multi agent".

The dashboard follows several coding-agent CLIs, not only Claude Code: Claude
Code, OpenAI Codex CLI and Google Gemini CLI. Wherever the brief above says
"Claude Code", read "each supported agent CLI". Claude Code stays the first and
best documented target; each agent CLI is optional, so the dashboard works with
any one of them installed. Hence the project's name, `agent-command-center`.
